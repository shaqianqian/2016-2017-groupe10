  Thank you very much. We will make some modifications,then we will do like this .

Ok
 
Can we do it next week?

Do it at your own pace
 
because our project is in the computer of fac.

That is WRONG! You should never leave your work in the lab's computer. Imagine that the computers in the lab are formatted. This means you could lose all your work, and you'll have to re-start from the beginning.

I mean, you should never, ever, do that not for opendevs, neither for other lectures, nor even at work.

From now on, everything you do should be committed in a repository. It could be a public repository like github, or a private repository like bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/).

Hi,

So, you want to contribute it? Let's make it like this:

Ecstatic source code is in here:

https://github.com/guillep/ecstatic

If you go in there, you'll see there is a folder "themes" where there is a folder for each theme.

What you should do is the following:
 1) create a fork of the repository (click on the fork button on github)
     - this will create a copy of the repository for yourselves
     - in your fork, you will be able to make all the changes you want, and then, once it is ready, you can "push" your changes to my original repository. This operation is called a "pull request". 

 2) After creating the fork, you can add your theme to the "themes" folder in your repository.
 3) Test that it works well with ecstatic. With this I mean:
   - check that from the console you can do "ecstatic theme **yourTheme**"
 4) Create a pull request to my repository, clicking the pull request button.
    - This will issue me a notification telling me that I can take your work.
    - I will review it and comment it, and if everything is ok, I can integrate it.

Hello,

you mean you want a website like these:

https://www.spotify.com/fr/
https://bintray.com/

or

http://appimage.org/

?

That would be cool. How would you name your theme? Do you already have some html/css for it?
